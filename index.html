      <h1 class="Title">Welcome to USACO Bootloader!</h1>
      <p>
        When starting out for USACO as a beginner with zero experience in coding
        or problem solving, it can be difficult to get going. I personally
        myself have this struggle, but I manage to get going and the rest is
        just about grinding problems. I barely know how to code and my problem
        solving skill is bad. It took me a while until I find resources that
        really help me as a beginner. Noted that this is focus on Pre-Bronze
        division. This is a resource that can help you started in your
        competitive programming journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Codecademy is an awesome resource to learn C++. It will teach you all
        the C++ that require to do get started solving problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        HackerRank give you problem to practice on. You can practice your math, problem solving skill or even get better with C++.
